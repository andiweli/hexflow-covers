# HEXFlow Covers & Backgrounds
Cover images and background pictures for HEXFlow.

***Update 03.11.2020:** Updated folder structure for HEXFlow.*

This is a collection of some handmade, simple and tidy *(nearly official-like)* cover images for VitaHEX Games' "HEXFlow" launcher, a fantastic launcher made available for Sony PSVITA. In addition you will also find some backgrounds suitable for HEXFlow. The collection is constantly growing...

## What you need?
https://github.com/VitaHEX-Games/HexFlow-Launcher

As mentioned by VitaHEX:
> Place your custom covers in "ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/"

Since all cover images have to be named by the App ID of the game, I have named them "AppID.png". A listing with the associated game names is included.
HEXFlow will search for suitable cover images and show them instead of the game icon (default).

## Custom Backgrounds
You have just to copy them over to "ux0:/data/HexFlow/" and rename the background you like to "background.png".<br>
**Hint:** For the best view-experience you should disable the reflections: Head over to ux0:/app/HXFL00001/DATA and rename box.obj and cover.obj to something like box.obj.orig and cover.obj.orig. Then you have to rename the files box_noreflx.obj to box.obj and cover_noreflx.obj to cover.obj - That's it! :)

**Note:**<br>
At the moment most of the covers are EU-covers. You can file an issue for cover requests if you want.<br>
A .PSD file for Adobe Photoshop is available now too, where you can create your own covers in 250x320! I always export them as 256 color .PNGs to save space.<br>
Have fun!
