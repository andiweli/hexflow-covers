**The most complete collection of PSVita/PSP/PS1/Homebrew covers available for [RetroFlow-Launcher](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher) and the original [HexFlow-Launcher](https://github.com/VitaHEX-Games/HexFlow-Launcher).**

## Latest News
* **Update 08.02.2025:**<br>
Thanks again to jimbob4000 for 9 new covers and 1 updated one.<br>
I also added **6 free-to-use loopable background music-tracks**. The music was taken from the never released Amiga game "PhaseOut" back in the 90s for which I did the music for. Years later a C64 version [became available](https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/Phase_Out).

or<br>
https://github.com/VitaHEX-Games/HexFlow-Launcher

**Note for HexFlow-Launcher:**
> You don't need to manually copy the covers over to your SD. The latest HexFlow-Launcher has a built-in "Scan covers and update" option which makes it easy for you to update all available covers on the go. 

**Hint for Homebrew covers not showing:**
> You have to manually set the category to "PS Vita" by entering settings of the game via triangle-button - otherwise the cover won't show up!

## Custom Music
Place your *.ogg files inside /data/RetroFlow/MUSIC in case of using [RetroFlow Launcher](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher).

## Custom Backgrounds
You have just to copy them over to "/data/RetroFlow/WALLPAPER" in case of using [RetroFlow Launcher](https://github.com/jimbob4000/RetroFlow-Launcher) or "/data/HexFlow/" in case of using the original [HexFlow Launcher](https://github.com/VitaHEX-Games/HexFlow-Launcher) and rename the background you like to "background.png".<br>

A .PSD file for Adobe Photoshop is available too, where you can create your own covers in 250x320! I always export them as 256 color .PNGs to save space - Have fun!
