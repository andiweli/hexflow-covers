## What is it?
This is a collection of some handmade, simple and tidy *(nearly official-like)* cover images and many others for VitaHEX Games' "HEXFlow" launcher, a fantastic launcher made available for Sony PSVITA. In addition you will also find some backgrounds suitable for HEXFlow. The collection is constantly growing...

**Note to YOU ALL:**<br>
> Thanks to the community nearly ALL games are "covered" with this collection - as well as most homebrews!

## What you need?

**Note for latest HEXFlow update:**
> You don't need to manually copy the covers over to your SD. HEXFLow has a built-in "Scan covers and update" option which makes it easy for you to update all available covers on the go. 

**Hint for Homebrew covers not showing:**
> You have to manually set the category to "PS Vita" by entering settings of the game via triangle-button - otherwise the cover won't show up!

## Custom Backgrounds
You have just to copy them over to "ux0:/data/HexFlow/" and rename the background you like to "background.png".<br>

A .PSD file for Adobe Photoshop is available too, where you can create your own covers in 250x320! I always export them as 256 color .PNGs to save space - Have fun!
